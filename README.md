## Results and Evaluation

### Performance of Models
The performance of the models was evaluated using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and R-squared (R²) scores:
- **XGBoost:** The XGBoost model achieved an RMSE of 4.32 and an R² score of 0.79, indicating a good level of accuracy but not the best performance among the models tested.
- **Random Forest:** This model achieved the best performance with an RMSE of 3.92 and an R² score of 0.83, suggesting it made the most accurate predictions and explained the most variance in the data.
- **SVR:** The SVR model had an RMSE of 5.75 and an R² score of 0.62, showing it was less effective compared to the other models in predicting food delivery times.

### Best Model
Based on the evaluation metrics, the Random Forest model emerged as the best-performing model:
- **Lowest RMSE of 3.92:** This indicates the model made the smallest prediction errors.
- **Highest R² score of 0.83:** This shows the model explained the most variance in the data.
- **Robustness:** The model effectively handled complex interactions between features and avoided overfitting, making it a reliable choice for predicting food delivery times.

### Feature Importance

The analysis revealed that the top seven attributes were critical for predicting delivery times. Including additional features did not significantly improve the outcomes.

| Feature                   | Importance |
|---------------------------|------------|
| Delivery_person_Ratings  | 0.223603   |
| Weatherconditions        | 0.178007   |
| multiple_deliveries      | 0.140234   |
| Road_traffic_density     | 0.116099   |
| distance                 | 0.107259   |
| Delivery_person_Age      | 0.080151   |
| Vehicle_condition        | 0.079843   |

## Conclusion

This project underscores the crucial role of data-driven insights in optimizing delivery operations. Through comprehensive analysis, Random Forest emerged as the most accurate model for predicting food delivery times, showcasing its robustness and effectiveness with this type of dataset. The study also highlighted the importance of key features such as delivery person ratings, weather conditions, and road traffic density in forecasting delivery times. By focusing on these factors, food delivery companies can significantly improve their prediction accuracy and overall service efficiency, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction.
